          Hi, I'm Carl John Zamudio, a recent Information Technology graduate from Central Philippines State University, Hinigaran Campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed a capstone project titled "Student Feedback System with Sentimental Analysis," highlighting my skills and dedication to impactful solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise includes front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, particularly using React. I value clean, maintainable code and continuously seek new learning opportunities to stay current with industry trends. Collaboration in diverse teams is something I greatly enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I love playing video games and coding, which fuels my passion for technology.
